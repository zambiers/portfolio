When the sudden death of a local figure ignites controversy, youâ€™re tasked with preparing their final rites, but the story of their life is anything but clear. Conflicting accounts from the townspeople paint vastly different pictures of who they were, and even the body itself holds secrets waiting to be uncovered.",

          I'm currently a Senior in Computer Science and Software Engineering at University of Washington Bothell. For the past year and a half, 
          I've been focusing on the programming ascept, and more recently started to do techinical animation/ artistry.    
           My preferred game engine is Unreal Engine, while having a background with Blender and Motion Capture.

          Whether it's prototyping mechanics, optimizing performance, or 
          adding polish with simple animations, I enjoy bringing ideas to life and learning new 
          tools and techniques along the way. I'm always looking to collaborate, and learn another thing or two 
          while making something fun to play.
